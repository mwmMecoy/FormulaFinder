# Formula Finder
This is a passion project. Having a child during the pandemic made me acutely aware of the formula shortage and how quickly it could lead to stress. The goal is to create an application that even with the smallest user base can make it more convenient to check the availability of types of formula in your local area.

I've found this helpful even with a small user base, as it can act as a helpful tool to keep track of inventory trends and formula types even for a single user on their trips to their local stores.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, cloudinary

My first solo project constructed from the ground up. Started with a simple note taking app that evolved into a note sharing app, and finally built out using the idea of sharing up-to-date inventories of local stores formula selection.

## Optimizations
If user base was going to increase then implementing a search function would become necessary.



## Lessons Learned:
How to use cloudinary to allow image uploads.
First build using TailWindCSS in place of BootStrap.


## To Do:
• Remove remaining snippets of BootStrap and convert to TailWindCSS
• Add additional display information to location product updates (brands, types)
• (Future update) brands as types as radial selections instead of string entry
